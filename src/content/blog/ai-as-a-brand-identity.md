In 2007, Apple re-branded from ‘_Apple Computers_’ to simply ‘_Apple_’. This might not register as a particularly significant change, but I don't think it's importance should be understated. Not only did this better reflect their broader focus beyond just computers, but it was a strategic move away from an outdated moniker that bound their brand identity to the value prop of what became a saturated, commonplace technology.

Why specify ‘computers’ in your name when that’s the foundation of your industry?

Why bound the consumer perception of what your company is good for, at all?

## Today's analog

**I roll my eyes into the back of my skull every time I see a startup wrapping 3rd party APIs aggressively marketing themselves as an 'AI startup’'.**

Alright fine, not _every_ time - so let me clear up exactly who I’m referencing here. In my mind, there's four distinct personas, and they each fall somewhere on this poorly made '_AI Company-to-Company Using AI_' quadrant chart:

![AI Company-to-Company Using AI chart](/chart.png)

1. **AI Innovators & Leaders:**
   Leading AI research and innovation, building the core technologies themselves
2. **Domain-Specific AI Solutions:**
   Continuously improving & applying AI capabilities to specific domains or industries
3. **AI-Driven Integrators:**
   Heavily leveraging AI in their offerings, but not necessarily involved in improving or building core AI technologies
4. **AI-Enabled Integrators:**
   Using AI to enhance their offerings without being primarily AI-focused, and no involvement in improving or building core AI technologies

I'm primarily referencing those that fall into 4 & 3, and sometimes even 2. These are startups that should be treating AI capabilities as complementary features to an otherwise viable product, rather than forcing it to take center stage.

## Looking forward

In the next 10 years - other than those advancing the bleeding edge of AI - there's just not really going to be AI companies, apps, or features anymore. This technology will have become so pervasively embedded in everything that they'll just be companies, apps, and features again. Then maybe something else will come along, and the cycle will start over.

It's a redundant, short-sighted footgun for your brand identity to be so deeply woven in with technologies that, sooner or later, are going to either **become foundational & obvious**, or **flop, and fade into obscurity**. I'd even go as far to say that brazenly mis-categorizing yourself in this way is a dog whistle alerting to weak teams that are incapable of maintaining an authentic, consistent vision.

_So lets stop grabbing up those horrible little `.ai` domain names_

_And lets also stop littering our marketing materials with ✨this emoji for some reason✨ and plastering `AI` all over the god damn place._

Position your business to embrace the tools of the future, and build great products with them; but don't box yourself into being something you're not, or that you don't need to be in the first place.
