I initially began writing this in my notes app to reflect on some of my own experiences over the last few years. With the advent of vibecoding, the subsequent democratization of turning ideas into products, and products into startups, it felt like there might be latent value for the hoards of first-time technical founders finding themselves in similar positions.

#### **Joining a pre-seed startup as a young, first-time technical founder can feel electrifying.**

It feels like you’re leapfrogging peers at your day job. Like you’ve unlocked a shortcut to financial independence, or maybe even early retirement. You’re not just an engineer anymore, no. You’ve ascended to being both a founder AND an entrepreneur as well. A veritable goddamn wunderkind.

The part that’s easy to underestimate and hand-wave away when becoming a pre-seed technical founder is that it usually means you’re also the very first engineer. Often the only one. You’re writing the code, shipping the product, fixing production issues, and making architectural decisions that will either carry the company forward or quietly haunt it for years.

No big deal, right? You’ve held engineering roles before, and probably still do at your day job, but this is different. There’s no employment contract, W-2. or 1099. On paper, you’re a founder. In practice, somebody still has to do the work, and the work will never, ever stop coming.

And that somebody is you.

You’re both a founder _and_ an employee.  
You both run the company _and_ work for the company.  
You operate at the highest level _and_ the lowest level at the same time.

And in return, your incentive is equity.

You probably know what that means, or at least think you do, but let’s slap a loose definition on it anyway.

**Equity is merely the promise of money, someday in the future.**

And that promise only ever materializes through one of three events:

1. The company goes public
2. The company is acquired
3. The company is bought out

Until one of those events occurs, your equity is worth exactly nothing.

Which means the real question you need to ask yourself is this:

**How long are you willing to function as a founder, engineer, and possibly the manager of other engineers, while also working your day job, with no guaranteed compensation on the horizon?**

Everybody has a tipping point. Mine was three years.

The truth of the matter is that a person can only be motivated to work so long without money. The only reason you, I, or anybody else on this planet works any given job is for guaranteed money, full stop.

You’re not working to finance a company, or the lives of others working for the company. You’re working to finance your own life.

Purpose, learning, prestige, and passion are all real, but they’re secondary. They don’t pay mortgages. They don’t fund retirements. They don’t pay vet bills. They don’t justify years of uncompensated labor if the downside is unlimited and the upside is hypothetical.

When you get involved in a pre-seed startup, you need to contractualize compensation expectations early. That way, once the company becomes revenue generating and the right milestone is hit, **there’s no guesswork about when money plus equity becomes your incentive**.

That can take many shapes:

- X% of Y% of net profit
- Hourly compensation
- A fixed monthly amount

The structure matters less than the existence of the agreement. Because **equity alone is not compensation**. Equity is risk.

And risk without boundaries isn’t brave, honorable, or charitable. It’s denial.
