A few months ago, my fianc√© and I looking at photos of an Italian place here in Sacramento called Sampinos and noticed tons of photos of the same little boy over the years wearing different clothes & eating different foods there.

Like any other reasonable person, I went to the profile of the user who posted them and ended up going down a rabbit hole.

## Yelp features you probably didn't know about

Some Yelp features you probably didn't know about (in order of ascending absurdity):

- Add friends/followers
- Send DMs
- Collect & earn badges for performing certain actions within the app
- Appoint yourself a nickname that's displayed in an **aggressively large font** at the top of your profile, e.g:
  - Rich "Grandpa of the unofficial Yelp Kid" L (guy who posted all those photos)
  - Gregg "G-Money" R
  - ED "I say Yelp it! Yelp it good! Yelp it real good!" L
  - Denyce "Queen of the Universe" M
  - Sue "Always me!!" G
  - Latifa "Energizer bunny" S
- Post public, oddly flirty predetermined 'compliments' to other user's profiles, e.g:
  - Cute Pic
  - Hot Stuff
  - Like Your Profile
  - You're Cool
  - You're Funny

## Yelp-specific social constructs you probably didn't know about

- Users have developed their own in-app language and colloquialisms, e.g:
  - SYOY (a common valediction acronym used at the end of public compliments meaning See You On Yelp)
  - Yelpers (collective noun for Yelp users)
  - Yelping (verb for using Yelp)
  - Referring to each other as Elites/Barons/Dukes, etc (more on that below)
- They've developed social hierarchies, e.g:
  - Yelp Elite Squad - Highly active users considered 'role models' by a Yelp-appointed admin team who will either approve or deny your application to join. Elite-worthiness is based on review popularity, photo quality, detailed personal profile, and having a positive account standing. If the application is approved, the user is awarded with an 'Elite badge' on their Yelp profile. After being Elite for 5 years, members receive a Gold Elite Badge; after 10 years, they receive the coveted Black Elite Badge.
  - Yelp Royalty - Users with the most check-ins at a venue are awarded with the title of Duke/Duchess. Those with the most titles in their neighborhood become the Baron/Baroness. Those with the most it the city become the King/Queen.
- Users with more prestigious levels of royalty or Elite badge tiers are straight up celebrities on that site. Other users are constantly showering them with compliments relating to their reviews, badges, photos, level of royalty. They'll even just say good morning to them each day.
