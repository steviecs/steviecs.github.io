			 <h1>Really phoned in the design, didn't I?</h1>
			<p>
				That's fair, but I'm personally <span style="background-color: #FED398"> <b> l o v i n g </b> </span>
				the resurgence of minimally designed, all-function-little-fashion dev blogs. Anyway, despite the underwhelming design,
				I've actually been a part of building some really cool stuff, which you can find on my LinkedIn.

			<h2>Personal life<h2/> 
			<p>
				I live downtown Sacramento with my fiancÃ© and five cats (I know).
				You can catch me watching horror movies, reading comic books, riding bikes, drinking wine,
				baking sourdough pizza, and - counterintuitively to the last two things
				- exercising for fun.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Thinking about it now, I guess I kind of live like an adult version of Kevin McAllister.

			<h2>Career<h2/>
			<p>
				By day I build & design software with cool people for money at <a href="https://skyslope.com" target="_blank">SkySlope</a>.
				<br/>	
				By night I build & design software with other cool people, for no money at <a href="https://swayzio.com" target="_blank">Swayzio</a>.
				</p>
			<p>
				I've dabbled in building all sorts of things, but I'm primarily developing in a full stack capacity for the web now. I've used lot of different technologies with
				varying levels of comfortability & expertise, but instead of an exhaustive list, I'll
				just describe the stack that I'm happy with these days (in a format borrowed from the
				brilliant <a href="https://www.olivare.net/" target="_blank">Zach Olivare</a>):
