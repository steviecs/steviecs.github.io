			 <h1>ðŸ¤¦ Really phoned in the design, didn't I?</h1>
			<p>
				That's fair, but I'm personally <span style="background-color: #FED398"> <b> l o v i n g </b> </span>
				the resurgence of minimally designed, function-over-fashion dev blogs. Anyway, despite the underwhelming design,
				I've actually been a part of building some really cool stuff, which you can find on my LinkedIn.

			<h2>Personal life<h2/> 
			<p>
				I live downtown Sacramento with my fiancÃ© and five cats (I know).
				You can catch me watching horror movies, drinking wine,
				baking sourdough pizza, and - counterintuitively to the last two things - exercising for fun.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Also, I build & design software with cool people for money at <a href="https://skyslope.com" target="_blank">SkySlope</a>.
				<br/>	
				<br/>
				<b>ALSO also</b>, I build & design software with a different group of cool people, for considerably less money at <a href="https://swayzio.com" target="_blank">Swayzio</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Career<h2/>
			<p>I'm an indivdually contributing software engineer by day, and a co-founder/CTO by night.</p>
			<p>
				Although I've dabbled in all sorts of things, but I'm pretty committed to strictly developing for the web now, at this point.
				I've used lot of different technologies with
				varying levels of comfortability & expertise, but instead of an exhaustive list, I'll
				just desribe the stack that I'm happy with these days (in a format borrowed from the
				brilliant <a href="https://www.olivare.net/" target="_blank">Zach Olivare</a>):
