			<h2>Personal life<h2/> 
			<p>
				I live downtown Sacramento with my wife and numerous cats, spending my free time watching horror movies, reading comic books, going to punk shows, baking pizza, and exercising.
			</p>
			<h2>Career<h2/>
			<p>
				By day I build software with cool people for money at <a href="https://skyslope.com" target="_blank">SkySlope</a>.
				<br/>	
				By night I build software with <i>other</i> cool people, for less money at <a href="https://swayzio.com" target="_blank">Swayzio</a>.
				</p>
			<p>
				I've dabbled in building all sorts of things, but I'm primarily developing in a full stack capacity for the web now. I've used lots of different technologies with
				varying levels of comfortability & expertise, but instead of an exhaustive list, I'll
				just describe the stack that I'm happy with these days (in a format borrowed from the
				brilliant <a href="https://www.olivare.net/" target="_blank">Zach Olivare</a>):
